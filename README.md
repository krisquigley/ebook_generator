[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/krisquigley/ebook_generator?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Rails gem to generate eBooks using the Markdown syntax to format content for sections of the book.

An example of this gem being used can be found at: [ebook-generator.affinity-tech.com](http://ebook-generator.affinity-tech.com)

Requires:
- Rails 4
- Rubyzip (to generate the .epub)
- Redcarpet (to render Markdown into HTML)
- Kindlegen (to generate .mobi files)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ebook_generator'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ebook_generator

## Usage

Generate the tables needed to process the ebooks:
`rails generate ebook_generator`

Migrate the database:
`rake db:migrate`

Pass the ebook object you want to generate:
`EbookGenerator.generate_ebook(ebook_object)`

This will then generate an ePub based on the values in the db and output to the /tmp folder.

For a Kindle mobi file then pass in `kindle` as the second argument:
`EbookGenerator.generate_ebook(ebook_object, 'kindle')`

To enable the generation of Kindle mobi files then you will first need to download the [kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)
command line tool from Amazon and put it in your apps `/bin` directory.
